# VBA-report-splitter
Put this code on a Macro-enabled Excel file. Create a button and assign btnSelectFile_Click() to it. The output files will be generated in the same folder as the selected source file. The source file will be split at every 350 rows. For example, if the source file contains 2500 rows, there will be 8 output files in the end.
